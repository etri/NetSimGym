# NetSimGym

NetSimGym is a wrapper library to interwork [Gymnasium](https://gymnasium.farama.org/) (Gym) and [NetSim](https://tetcos.com/). 

It is designed for users who want to apply reinforcement learning (RL) in NetSim simulation. 

NetSimGym exploits **[Protocol Buffers](https://protobuf.dev/)** to interconnect Gym and NetSim to each other. 

We recommend you to understand Gym and NetSim before using NetSimGym. 

## Installation

As pre-requisite, you should have Python, NetSim and Protocol Buffers installed on your machine. 

[Gym](https://github.com/Farama-Foundation/Gymnasium) library is also required. 

Clone this repository on your machine and try to run the examples.
